🌳 Deforestation Detection Using Deep Learning and Streamlit

📘 Overview

This project is a web-based application that detects deforestation from satellite or aerial images using Deep Learning.
It uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) built with TensorFlow to classify images as either Deforested or Healthy Forest.
A simple and interactive Streamlit interface allows users to upload images and view predictions instantly.

🧠 How It Works

1. Image Input:
Users upload an image of a forest or land area via the Streamlit interface.


2. Preprocessing:
The image is resized and converted into an array format using NumPy and Pillow.


3. Prediction:
The pre-trained CNN model (built with TensorFlow) analyzes the image and predicts whether it represents a Deforested Area or Healthy Forest.


4. Output:
The result and confidence score are displayed instantly on the Streamlit dashboard.
